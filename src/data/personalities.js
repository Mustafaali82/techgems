    description: "Co-founder of Apple Inc., inventor, and business magnate.",
    story: `
      Steve Jobs was born on **February 24, 1955**, in **San Francisco, California**, USA. He was adopted shortly after birth by Clara and Paul Jobs, who raised him in **Mountain View**, California. Jobs developed an early interest in electronics, spending time in his father’s garage learning how things worked. His adoptive father helped him foster an interest in craftsmanship.
  
      **Education**: 
      Jobs attended **Reed College** in Portland, Oregon, for just one semester before dropping out, citing that he did not want to waste his parents' money on an education that didn’t inspire him. However, he continued auditing classes, taking a calligraphy class that later influenced the design of Apple’s iconic fonts.
  
      **Apple's Founding and Growth**: 
      In 1976, at the age of 21, Jobs co-founded **Apple** alongside his friends **Steve Wozniak** and **Ronald Wayne** in his garage. The company's first product, the Apple I, was developed by Wozniak and sold as a circuit board. However, it was the introduction of the **Apple II** in 1977 that marked the company’s first big success. Apple's breakthrough product, the **Macintosh**, was released in 1984 and revolutionized personal computing with its user-friendly graphical interface.
  
      **Departure from Apple**: 
      After a period of internal conflict with Apple’s board of directors, Jobs was ousted from the company in 1985. Following his departure, Jobs went on to **found NeXT**, a computer company that specialized in high-end workstations, and **Pixar**, a studio that created animated films like *Toy Story*. His work at Pixar was pivotal in revolutionizing animated films and technology.
  
      **Return to Apple and Major Achievements**: 
      In 1997, Apple acquired NeXT, bringing Jobs back into the company he had founded. He became CEO and helped rescue Apple from near bankruptcy by focusing on innovation. Under his leadership, Apple introduced groundbreaking products such as the **iMac**, **iPod**, **iPhone**, and **iPad**—products that reshaped industries including personal computing, music, telecommunications, and entertainment.
  
      **Philanthropy and Legacy**: 
      Despite his massive success in business, Jobs was somewhat private about his personal life and philanthropic efforts, with limited public charitable donations. However, his legacy as an innovator, designer, and visionary entrepreneur continues to inspire millions. He is remembered not only for his transformative contributions to technology but also for his role in creating an entirely new business model and cultural ecosystem around Apple’s brand.
  
      **Personal Life**: 
      Jobs married **Laurene Powell** in 1991, and together they had three children. His personal life became more public following his battle with **pancreatic cancer**, a diagnosis he received in 2003. After years of health struggles, Jobs passed away on **October 5, 2011**, leaving behind a technological empire and a profound influence on the world.
  
      **Awards and Recognition**: 
      Jobs was honored with numerous awards throughout his lifetime, including being named **Person of the Year** by *Time* magazine in 2001 and appearing in *Fortune's* list of the world’s most admired businesspeople.

    description: "Mathematician, logician, and computer science pioneer.",
    story: `
      Alan Turing, born on **June 23, 1912**, in **Maida Vale, London**, is widely regarded as one of the most influential figures in the history of computer science. His work laid the foundations for modern computing, and his contributions during World War II helped win the war for the Allies by breaking the German Enigma code.
  
      **Early Life**: 
      Turing demonstrated a precocious aptitude for mathematics and science from an early age. After attending **Sherborne School**, where he began developing an interest in mathematical problems, Turing went on to study at **King's College, Cambridge**, where he graduated with first-class honors in **Mathematics** in 1934. He later went to the **Princeton University** in the United States to further his studies, earning a doctorate in 1938.
  
      **Work during World War II**: 
      Turing is best known for his role in the **British Government Code and Cypher School** at **Bletchley Park** during World War II, where he worked on deciphering the **Enigma machine**, a complex encryption machine used by the Germans. Turing's theoretical work led to the development of the **Turing machine**, a conceptual model for digital computers, which was the foundation for computer science. His ingenuity allowed him to design a machine, later known as the **Bombe**, that was able to break the Enigma cipher and ultimately help end the war.
  
      **Post-War Contributions**: 
      After the war, Turing continued to contribute to computing, focusing on machine intelligence and creating the **Turing Test**, which proposed a method for determining whether a machine could exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human. Despite his profound impact on computer science, Turing's post-war career was marred by the fact that he was prosecuted for his homosexuality, which was criminalized in the UK at the time.
  
      **Death and Legacy**: 
      In 1952, Turing was convicted of "gross indecency" due to his homosexuality and was chemically castrated as a result. His career was effectively ruined, and he died on **June 7, 1954**, in what is widely believed to be a suicide by cyanide poisoning. It was only decades later, in 2009, that the British government issued an official apology for his treatment. Turing is considered one of the fathers of modern computing, and his work continues to be revered by researchers and historians.
  
      **Awards and Recognition**: 
      Turing's achievements and legacy have been widely recognized. In 1966, the **Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)** established the **Turing Award**, which is often described as the "Nobel Prize of Computing," in his honor. The **Turing Institute** was established in the UK, and in 2013, Queen Elizabeth II granted him a **posthumous royal pardon**.
      
      **Controversy**: 
      While Turing's contribution to cryptography, artificial intelligence, and mathematics are irrefutable, his mistreatment by the British government serves as a painful part of his legacy. Despite his immense scientific contributions, his wrongful conviction for his sexuality remains a dark chapter in history.

    story: `
      **Bjarne Stroustrup**, born on **December 30, 1950**, in **Aarhus, Denmark**, is a renowned computer scientist and the creator of the **C++ programming language**. C++ has become one of the most widely used programming languages in the world, powering everything from video games to enterprise applications, and is highly praised for its efficiency, versatility, and performance.
  
      **Early Life and Education**: 
      Stroustrup showed an early interest in mathematics and science. After completing his high school education, he attended the **University of Aarhus** in Denmark, where he earned his **Bachelor's degree** in **Computer Science**. He went on to complete his **Master's degree** and later received a **Ph.D.** in computer science from the **University of Cambridge**, UK, specializing in the field of simulation.
  
      **Creation of C++**: 
      In **1979**, Stroustrup began working on a project that would later result in the creation of C++, a programming language designed to extend the C programming language by adding object-oriented features. C++ was originally created to improve upon C by introducing concepts like **object-oriented programming** (OOP), **encapsulation**, **inheritance**, and **polymorphism**, without sacrificing the language’s efficiency.
  
      Stroustrup's vision was to create a language that combined the **efficiency and flexibility** of C with the **high-level features** of more modern programming languages like Simula, which helped introduce the object-oriented paradigm. The first version of C++ was released in **1985**, and it quickly gained popularity for its performance, flexibility, and suitability for system and application development.
  
      **C++ and Professional Success**: 
      Since its release, C++ has become one of the most influential programming languages in the world. It is heavily used in system software, game development, real-time applications, operating systems, and embedded systems. Stroustrup’s C++ language has also been influential in the development of other programming languages, such as **Java**, **C#**, and **Rust**.
